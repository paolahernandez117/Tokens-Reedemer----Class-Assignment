# Tokens-Reedemer----Class-Assignment
/* The video game machines at your local arcade output tokens according to how well you play the game.  You can redeem 10 tokens for a candy bar or 3 coupons for a gumball.  You prefer candy bars to gumballs. Write a program that defines a variable initially assigned to the number of  tokens you win. Next, the program should output how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your tokens on candy bars first, and any remaining tokens on gumballs.*/
